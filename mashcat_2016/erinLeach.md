Lightning talk, Erin Leach
==========================

- what does living in a post-MARC world look like
- kindness, soft skills are important
- should build better, authentic relationships with other professionals
- areas of mutual concern instead of "us versus them"
- drop the jargon
	- acronyms can be a barrier to communication
	- don't assume ppl know
- ongoing dialogue with ppl outside your department
- ask how you can help, not waiting to be invited
- how you can share your skills
