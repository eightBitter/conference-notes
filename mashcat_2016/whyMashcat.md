Q: What do we hope to gain from Mashcat, breaking down communication barriers
- barriers between different roles
	- metadata
	- archives
	- administrators
- administrative barriers
	- can be intimidating, especially with regards to terminology
- open source kind of helps break down the barrier, because somebody can come in and tinker. nothing's locked down

Q: How are we trying to make that change happen?
- try to talk internally
- share your work
- look for excuses to work with ppl in other departments. informal situations might be the best route
- having office hours in other departments
- Jenette from Brown, internal metadata groups, try to ping IT ppl
- Ronda from MIT, workshops, communities of practice
- having a brief workshop to tackle a particular problem set
	- could this work in a university that doesn't have tech-savvy staff?
- language is important. understand how others will translate what you are saying

Q: How do we see critlib, libtechwomen, etc intersecting with Mashcat?

	- a lot of ppl don't feel welcome
	- feeling of imposter syndrome
- how to show accessibility
- *hackerschool rules
- it's okay to be wrong. listen generously

	- how do we make those personal connections
	- "the panel of the usual suspects." try to invite unusual suspects
		- bringing in unusual suspects
- Chris, Harvard Astronomy something, part of Dot Astro

	- trying to get ppl included
	- professional development is really important in libraries
		- managers should go to conferences like this

	- Terry Reese
	- Owen Stephens
