==========================================================

- zine = physical pub
- libraries are collecting zines
- DIY culture
- wanting to create a union catalog for zines
- anybody would need to be accessible by any type of libraries
- Zine Core, modification of Dublin Core
- joining in discussing what the zine union catalog might look like
- stock questions
	- where will all the disparate data live
	- how will data ingestion happen
	- how will make the data editable and linked open data
	- what tools to use

Q: what about specific use-cases?

Session
-------

- they have a GitHub account
- shying away from drupal-based platforms
- create data about the works, holding records, or authorities?
	- all of the above, preferrably linked data
- what types of authorities?
	- Anchor Archive subject headings
	- LCSH
- Zine producers are out of scope
- best practices?

Walkaways
------
- not LCSH
- not traditional ILS
- possibly using DPLA's model
- being responsive to the zine community
- want an API to do stuff with it
- using Amazon hosting services?
- Solr-based, or Hydra, need technical expertise
- Islandora Claw (Islandora with Fedora 4)
- privacy issues
	- would this cause any privacy issues
- would the zines be digitized?
	- no, connecting to the holdings records of physical zines
- startup grants?
- types of interfaces
- possibly using DC instead of ZineCore since DC is already RDF-ized
- need scope documents
- Zinester identity and geography
