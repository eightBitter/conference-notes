===========================

- some problem with MARC series and OPAC displays
- all the code is on github
- analysis
	- used Python and MarcEdit to analyze the data
	- needed a lot of logic to overlay the correct records for the OPAC
- used z39.50 to pull bulk records from OCLC
- PyMarc Google Group was useful
- Twitterverse
- Mapped out diagrams for the process so that there would be a good communication of what was needed from each end
- tested assertions through a small dataset
- added an acronym list at the end. this might be a good idea
- talk to your institution about contributing to the institution's github account
	- I know ISU library doesn't have an account
