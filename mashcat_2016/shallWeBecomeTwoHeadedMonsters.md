Shall we become two-headed monsters? Cross-disciplinary and multiliteracy perspectives for Mashcat's goals
=====================================

Katherine Deibel, University of Washington Libraries

Prepared talk

- large communication gap between developers and librarians
- one problem is that professionals try to stay in their box and become specialists within that box
- it's important to branch out of the box
- multidisciplinarity
	- a problem is split between professionals and they go work on it on their own
	- ultimately gets to the point where the two sides get mushed together
		- this sparks communication between the two professionals
	- interdisciplinarity
		- bridging the communication gap
		- info science and biology merged and became bioinformatics
			- is this the way Mashcat should go?
- "I propose not"
- transdisciplinarity
	- literacies instead of disciplines
- multiliteracy
	- ability to read and write to the expectations within a specific genre or discipline
- OpenRefine, Excel, XSL involves coding, so if you can use them you are code literate
- "let your extra head grow as mush as you want"
- code-thinking as a literacy
	- code-thinking is basically debugging

Q: resources for learning how to think in code instead of syntax
- will definitely look into
- plug for a book, was tweeting, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programming
