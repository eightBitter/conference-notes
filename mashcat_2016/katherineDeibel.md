=========================

Value Sensitive Design

- four values
	- human values
	- interactional perspective
	- Stakeholders, not users
	- Tripartite methodology
- Bruno Latour
- respecting users, ethics, etc. is inherent
- ready avenues for researchers of different backgrounds to collaborate on the same project
- weaknesses of VSD
	 - VSD does not have good protocols to avoid being swamped by too many values or stakeholders
- opportunities
	- VSD has not been applied to library practices
	- will allow us to discuss the challenges we are facing
