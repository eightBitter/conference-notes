mashcat meets the org chart
==============

Presenters
---------

- Holly Tomren

Notes
-----

- communication challenges among metadata/cataloging ppl, archives, and IT
- year ago there was a major restructuring of the org at Drexel
- "Data & Digital Stewardship" department
	- metadata, archives, data services
- communication venues
	- management team
	- division meetings
	- data services metings
	- LibWiki
- metadata unit services shifted to facilitate the institutional repository
- benefits from reorg: same boss, same goals, joint decisions

QA
--

- any change in physical space?
	- no, everybody is currently in the same place, but there is interest to move units closer/mix units
- what is the impact on archives unit
	- much more emphasis on digital content
	- getting more support for their collections from metadata ppl and tech ppl
