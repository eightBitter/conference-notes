Linked People: Collaborations Between Metadata Librarians and Programmers
============================

Presenters
----------

- Jeremy Myntti
- Anna Neatrour
- Liz Woolcott

Notes
-----

- will be talking about a grant-funded project
- background
	- challenges with names and bad authority control
	- interest in using authorities other than LC. don't have resources to add other authorities to LC
	- pilots to reconcile names. some issues
- IMLS grant to investigate how to create controlled vocabularies for local names
- steps
	- investigation
	- evaluation and testing (current phase)
	- pilot implementation
	- assessment and future planning
- collaborating with programmers in library
	- a lot of discussion with the programmers to come up with solutions
- partner perspectives
	- one challenge for partners: not a lot of IT support
	- most institutions are on CDM, some on Hydra and Islandora
	- mostly historical/archival material
	- mostly images and text, some audio and video
- desires
	- regional linked data repository
	- documentation for creating linked data compliant authorities
- Phase 1: data model review
	- decided on EAC-CPF
	- mentioned SNAC: name authority in a linked data context
	- going to do a bare-bones model
- Phase 1: metadata wrangling
	- compiled everything into one master spreadsheet
	- deduplicating data
		- formulas in Excel
		- standardization
	- reconciling spreadsheet against LC linked data service
	- deduplicated from 500k to 76k
- Phase 2: investigation tools
	- creating a massive grid for evaluating controlled vocabulary software
- things metadata ppl care about
	- workflow issues
	- discovery issues
- things programmers care about
	- ease of installation
	- ongoing support
	- API availability
	- software type
- possibly building out a reconciliation service for partners
- Phase 3: pilot implementation
	- perform full eval
	- data enhancement
	- developing and documenting workflows
- Phase 4: assessment
	- explore impact
	- identify training opportunities

QA
--

- identifiers? aggregating identifiers?
	- yes, we want to build identifiers
- would it be open authorities? opened to local societies and beyond
	- yes, these vocabularies will be truly open
- process of narrowing down 12 instances of a name?
	- easy if the name is already in LC
	- if not, will investigate in the future
