Mashcat facilitated discussion
==============================

Question prompts
----------------

- pressing concerns in library data?
- what can the Mashcat community do to meet these needs
- what skills can you share to help meet the needs

Concerns
--------

- systems guiding cataloging practice instead of best practices
	- Alma, Primo
	- Deduplication challenges
	- Technical standards vs Data standards
- data modeling
- rich data in fields (rare books example), how do we leverage and migrate it
- description vs discovery
	- how to munge data that's meant for description to data that's meant for discovery
- scalability
- organizational inertia
- staffing problems. value of people
- been stuck in MARC for a long time. Shouldn't get stuck into BIBFRAME (?)
	- begin with localization and then build crosswalks to standards
- not enough research to understand how our metadata should be served on the web
- we don't really have a good idea about how users want to use our data
- user communities of specific libraries (multi-library campus) has different preferences

What can we do to address the concerns
--------------------------------------

- forums like this (Mashcat) are useful
- consistent practices and documentation
- PCC has working groups that can be done in MARC to make it LD ready
- community building
- don't wait until BIBFRAME works perfectly; get something out there
- "discovery is almost too much". focusing on making discovery systems easier to use
	- always have to think about where to put your resources and time, so that it's the most benefit to users
- thinking about how we can build dynamic datasets based on our users
