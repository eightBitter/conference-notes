## OCLC product round table discussions: academic libraries session

### Challenges

- increasing push of library doing auxiliary services such as IT problems
- duplicate records in Connexion
- reduced staff
- cost of services
- integrating access to multiple systems/products through a single portal
- serving mobile tech users
- connecting students to library staff
- lack of collaboration with internal academic departments
- moving to Alma
- improve control of metadata in ContentDM
- linked data would be great, but we need the software/systems in place to employ it
- retraining/repurposing staff for other processes such as cataloging staff doing metadata work
- discoverability of resources
- integration with online learning systems like Blackboard
- how to track analytics

### Opportunities

- ILL for e-books
- show relevance of library to all departments of university
- collaboration with internal departments
- narrow services to what users really need/use
- cross-training of library staff
- consortial collaboration
- staff learning new skills as technology evolves
- spaces for collaborative learning
- how to effectively manage open access resources
  - need to have staff or software to manage OA services

### Top priorities

- budget - doing more with less
- revamping discoverability
  - Google-like experience
  - integrating multiple systems
- marketing
  - internal collaboration
- mobile
- analytics
- staff retraining and cross-training
- collaboration and resource sharing

It was ultimately determined that discoverability was collectively the most important priority.
