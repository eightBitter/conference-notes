Highlights from sessions attended
---------------------

### Keynotes

- listen to the communities your library serves
- we need serious conversations about how we can best serve our communities
- emphasis on telling a story and giving users the metadata and tools to tell their stories
- conference goers are the explorers/scouts of our libraries. They should come back and tell their experiences so that knowledge gained can be disseminated not only by the conference goer, but by their institution
- having an idea means nothing. Acting upon the idea is the key part
- need to tackle polarization, echo chambers, and fragmented communication

### Metadata

- OCLC is doing plenty of neat things with Linked Data. Let's hope they keep their Linked Data and discovery API open
- there a plenty of tools for data remediation and reconciliation, and the presenter graciously gave links to all the tools and code!
- emphasis on reconciliation and authority control

### Repositories

- still an emphasis on integrating tools with institutional repositories, and combining various repositories into a single repository
  - Islandora seems like a good option for this. However, Islandora does require a bit of IT dedication
- Islandora has functionality for combining finding aids into the same system that digital objects reside, which is pretty cool

### Knowledge Management

- need to facilitate buy-in from staff
  - openness
  - receiving input from staff
  - user testing
  - training!
- the structure needs to be logical and things need to be easy to locate
- need to deflate bad habits when possible
- GitHub can be a good tool for managing documents, including version control
  - GitHub has limitations and isn't appropriate for every type of knowledge management

### Project Management

- need buy-in/commitment to a single scope
- shared goals, shared commitment
- prepare as much before the project begins as possible

### Technology Education

- baby steps, don't overwhelm the staff
- real world examples. How can the staff apply what they're learning to their current job?

Overall Takeaways
-----------------

- we need better cross-department communication
  - openness is key
- we need to focus on our community, integrating them into the work we do (example: helping us identify people in photographs), and we need to facilitate telling stories
- we need to hire people who have tech skills, even if that's not their primary job responsibility. Technology is not going away, in fact it's rapidly evolving
- we need to facilitate "continuing education" in order to keep staff up-to-pace with the rapidly changing environment
- knowledge management is integral for a large institution to function at high efficiency
  - how can we better structure CyPoint?
  - how can we make it easier to locate assets in CyPoint?
  - how can we receive better buy-in by our library community?
    - more training is a recommendation
