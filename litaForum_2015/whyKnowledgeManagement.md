Why Knowledge Management? Achieving Organizational Buy-In Through a Unified and Holistic Approach... and the Right Technology Tools
=========================

Ian Chan, California State University San Marcos

Jorie Porter, California State University San Marcos

- implemented knowledge management system
- going to talk about the process
	- defining the initiative
	- choosing the technology
	- getting organizational buy-in
	- answering the "why" of knowledge management

The initial problems
-----------

- answering the same questions multiple times
	- would be good to document the first iteration of the question
- issues
	- lack of coherent strategy for knowledge sharing
	- lack of retainment of knowledge sharing
	- existing methods of sharing information were not well-used
	- too many places to share knowledge
		- email
		- listservs
		- various file-sharing
		- intranet drives
	- information silos
- *(would CyPoint be our central information-sharing hub?)*

- one of the main highlights is receiving buy-in from the top level
	- they received buy-in from a new dean *(we have the same opportunity)*

Starting at the top
-----------

- where does knowledge sharing fit in with organizational priorities
- what are leadership expectations regarding process and outcomes
- define scope
	- internal communication
	- document sharing
	- collaborative tools
	- information repositories that host library documents

The process
--------

- planning the system
	- assess needs
	- define initiative priorities
	- recommend technology solutions
- implementing the system
	- buy-in
	- training
	- making the system work

Task force
-------

- representation from all library stakeholders
- given specific charge
- define duration
- define the problems
- define the needs
- use-cases
- need for training

Assess and Prioritize
---------

- analyze questionnaire responses gathered from all units
	- created requirements/use-cases/deliverables

Selecting Technology Solutions
------------

- defined areas of needs based on analysis
- chose Confluence for solution

Implementation
--------------

- adoption
	- getting people to use the technology
- cross-library team

Site Architecture and Organization
----------

- determine what groups, projects, etc will exist in the system
	- easy = library units
	- harder = project or taskforce
	- "what stores in the mall"
		- do projects/taskforces need stores or shelfs
- content findability - navigation and searching
- what gets used the most and what gets used the least?
	- things that get used the most should be put on the landing page

Content and Workflows
---------------

- what content will go into the system?
	- organization vs units and groups
	- in scope and out of scope - published/shared vs working docs
		- how to work with working docs
- how will content be added to the system?
	- *(does CyPoint have interoperability with collaborative documents (ex. office 365 docs/google docs)*
	- integrating existing workflows

Training
--------

- value of the system
	- collaboration
	- congruence
		- linking to a single document in a Knowledge Management system instead of copying a document to a shared/local drive
	- ease
- started with slideshow of what a knowledge management site is and how it can help
- "what does everyone need to know to use the knowledge management system"
	- hour of in-class training
	- short videos on basics
		- *(we need to offer more CyPoint training, even possibly short videos, in order for staff to become more comfortable using CyPoint)*

Assessment
----------

- informal
	- feedback in biweekly meetings
	- feedback in training sessions
	- usage

- formal
	- surveys

What went well
-------------

- support and involvement of Library Admin throughout the process
- meeting notes template well-used across the organization
- mostly positive perception of value of the system

What went wrong
---------------

- different needs in different departments
	- can't have a blanket workflow
	- file sharing
		- box.com
			- has sync functionality
			- lose sync functionality if you link in Confluence
		- google drive
			- don't see changes until somebody saves, instead of live editing
- content upkeep
	- people have to use the site correctly
	- need ownership and governance of documents
- personalities and habit
	- people resist change
	- people going back to old habits
		- have to fight the old habits

Lessons Learned
---------------

- overwhelming the new users
	- can't throw too much at the staff
- budget extra time and calendaring the launch
	- making sure there is plenty of time for staff to get used to it before big work happens
- introduce features in stages with well-defined instructions
	- maybe add videos for features?

Q: file naming conventions?
- their knowledge management system was used to contain the "published" documents
- they used google drive and box for "working" documents

Q: archiving?
- not scope of their knowledge management system

Q: how do you address negative attitudes
- can't achieve 100% buy-in
- can achieve 100% opportunity for feedback
	- people need to feel comfortable providing feedback
	- *(getting people to feel comfortable doing this increases buy-in. when they're involved in the process they're more likely to give buy-in)*

Q: how do you address other concerns?

*(need buy-in of CyPoint. need much better organization of CyPoint. need training!)*
