Data Designed for Discovery
==========================

Roy Tennant, OCLC Research

- MARC was meant to print physical catalog cards. it's old
	- it's machine readable but not machine understandable
- our data is old. it just can't do what we need it to
- emphasis on defining entities (resources)
- shredding catalog records into components/resource descriptions
- they use FAST as a faceted approach to subject assignment
- "truthiness of data"
	- strategy for ranking data and finding accurate data
- can't do record translation. have to enhance the data
- assertions, not records
- entities enable connectivity
- entities enable efficiency and quality
- entities enable creativity
	- *(since Linked Data is modular, you can create unique, creative tools)*
