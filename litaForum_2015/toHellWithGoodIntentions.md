To Hell with Good Intentions
==============

Mark Matienzo, Digital Public Library of America

Context
-------

  - experience shapes who we are and affects our jobs
  - experience also brings bias
  - divisions between archives and technologies
  - people see what they want to see
  - libraries/archives/metadata shapes as much as it documents

Naming
------

- naming is the act of creating an identity. it imposes a pattern
- naming constructs reality
- classification (cataloging) and subject analysis shapes how we view resources
- metadata is not neutral (because humans assign metadata)
- Linked Data involves the naming of things
- opting into Schema Org (which was built by corporations) shapes our naming

Serving the community
---------------------

- **listen to the community**
- **serious conversations about how we can best serve our communities**
- Linked Data tools are hard to set up and use
- need simple tools for working with Linked Data
- **warns about over-centralization**

Telling a story
---------------

- <http://cirn.wikispace.com>
- <http://archivingpolicviolence.org>
- <http://findandconnect.gov.au>

Q: What informed you about all of this?
- his own experiences
- thinking about what has happened in the past six months (regarding discrimination and violence in the US)
- stepping back and asking if things we are doing are making an impact and actually affecting the community

Q: How do we check for "truthiness"?
- provenance (of metadata)
- tools for publishing/building narratives
  - how Linked Data can help facilitate this
    - instead of just publishing metadata/Linked Data

Q: Findability vs accurate naming?
- using an incorrect but commonly-used terms vs using a correct but rarely-used term
- no good answers yet
- need a push to change subject headings
  - what do we need to demand of Library of Congress in order to change inappropriate headings

*Thoughts on keynote*
---------------------

- *need to build tools that help the community leverage linked data*
- *focus on building narratives with linked data rather than just simply publishing linked data*
	- *though I think simply publishing linked data needs to come first*
- *APIs are much easier to use than SPARQL. SPARQL is appropriate for hardcore researchers. APIs are more appropriate for the public.*
	- *but even then what can we do to make re-using linked data more accessible to the public?*
- *digital exhibits can facilitate building a narrative. need to emphasize this instead of simply creating metadata and digital objects*
