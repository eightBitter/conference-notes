Introduction
------------

- trying to integrate institutional repository with other technologies
	- completely separate staff
	- completely separate unit
- hackathon to see if there was a way to make things more discoverable
	- successful enough to polish and make a reality
- integrated IR into Primo
- SFX link resolver
- their institutional repository is Hydra-based, uses Solr as index
	- there's no search API for their institutional repository yet
		- *(does BePress have an API?)*
- no changes were required in the institutional repository
- potential future
	- uncovered many UI issues in the institutional repository
	- create search API for institutional repository
- "How will we handle this when we move to a next-gen ILS, and possibly a new link resolver along with it?"

Integrating Institutional Repository with Catalog
---------------------------

- initially move public records over
- Primo as discovery layer
- institutional repository has self-deposit, and university professors don't want self-deposited things integrated, so this project is on hold

Future directions
-----------------

- push MD to google scholar, Primo Central, DPLA
- integrate with other Hesburgh Library systems and services
	- eReserves
	- digital exhibits
	- reformating database
	- ILLiad and Document Delivery
- integrate with other services
	- Open Science Framework
	- ORCID
	- Altmetrics
