Topics
------

- what is it
- what does it look like
- how does it work

What is it?
-----------

- most people don't really know what Linked Data is or how it will shape libraries
- how much will it cost?
- a lot of examples of Google and schema org
- *(so will she be talking about connecting libraries with schema org? probably)*

What the Web wants
------------------

- scale
- predictable structures
- a network of links
- entity identification
	- knowing what the "things" are
- Google currently pulls in data from Wikipedia, Amazon, etc as knowledge cards
- pulling out entities (resources) and descriptions
- *(a lot of the same content I saw at a Webinar last week by OCLC)*
- authority control to the Web

Using Linked Data and the WorldCat Discovery API to show timely holdings
-----------------------

- leveraging OCLC WorldCat Discovery API based on Linked data
	- *(will this API become public in the future? I sure hope so)*
- emphasis on entities
- using WikiPedia API document metadata to choose accurate WikiPedia data
- link to code on GitHub

- *(still in the exploratory stages of Linked Data. not thinking of policies or things like openness and business models)*
- *(what do the users need? how are they searching? what are they looking for?)*
	- *(this will help us design the appropriate entities?)*
